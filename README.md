# DnD-CharSheet
A character sheet for 5th edition dnd written in F#.

WORK IN PROGRESS.

So far not much is possible with it but the idea is to either let you view and edit the charactersheet and define 
some items or to generate a pdf file using latex for printing so that it can be brought to a game night.

You are more than welcome to write some additions to the project if you want to make an additional function or just wanna play 
arround.
